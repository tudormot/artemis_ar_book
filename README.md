# ARtemis AR book
MVP of Artemis learning, which is as of January 2023 put on hold indefinetly. 

A multiplatform app built with Unity, which showcases image detection triggering the beginning of various "AR experiences", meant to be educative and engaging. 

The idea was to create apps tailored for each book publisher (same codebase, different technical art), which would be used by the book's reader in conjunction with the images present in the book.


Based on AR Foundations, with the addition of some image stabilisation and custom shaders which make the AR experience more immersive. Heavily compressed showcase video:
